Hi.

You may be interested in my [site](https://linusboyle.cn) for academia. But in case you are not a fan of research papers:

## `/description`

- I use the ID `linusboyle` or `jmjzr`. If you see such IDs, it's very likely me.
- Currently I use an AMD-powered laptop with `Arch Linux`.
- I'm a stubborn Vim enthusiast.
- I like music, especially 70s Prog, New Age and 90s C-Pop. I could play a little bit Guqin.
- And guess what, I am a Gamemaster and player of CoC and DnD. I like playing CRPG, of course, and my favorite is *Neverwinter Nights*
