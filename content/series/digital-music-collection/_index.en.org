Streaming music is all the rage today. Sure, the idea behind music streaming is pretty attractive: you pay a small fee every month, and get access to all the music they have to offer. However, users of streaming music services never "own" the music: they just get access to the music library such services provide for a given period of time.

So, if you don't want to pay the monthly fee anymore, or the service no longer have the right to some music, you no longer have access to them.

That's when locally-stored music becomes desirable again. Although you have to manage your music manually and pay full price for the music[fn:1], it means you gain complete control of your music. Put them in your computer's hard drive and use your sick amp? No problem. Put them in your network-attached storage and listen anywhere in your home? No problem. Go old-school and put them modded iPod Classic and listen for days without draining your phone's battery? No problem. Or even [[/posts/walkman/record-to-minidisc][put them on a MiniDisc with a shell script]], because why not.

If you like the idea of personal digital music collection but don't know where to start, this post is for you!

[fn:1] Or not, if you choose the pirate hat. I would not recommend this since it hurts the musician, but as always, it's up to you.
